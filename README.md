# Derby Horse Race Prediction  

> ## A model that makes use of race data, field conditions and jockey information to identify what impacts the final position of a horse in a race and how successfully can this outcome be modelled.

Strategy and decision making based on game environment is a critical component in modern athletics.
Sports that involve animals, such as horse racing, are no different than human sport. Typically, efficiency
in movement correlates to both improvements in performance and injury prevention. A wealth of data is
now collected, including measures for heart rate, EKG, longitudinal movement, dorsal/ventral movement,
medial/lateral deviation, total power, and total landing vibration. 

The dataset being used has recently been made available by the New York Racing Association (NYRA) and
the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association (NYTHA). It is the first to provide researchers with
X/Y coordinate mapping of horses during races. The dataset provides information that can be used to
analyze jockey decision making, compare race surfaces, or measure the relative importance of drafting.
With considerable data, it is possible to explore new ways of racing and training in a highly traditional
industry. With improved use of horse tracking data, this project aims to improve equine welfare,
performance and rider decision making.
